Docusaurus has a canary releases system.

It permits you to **test new unreleased features** as soon as the pull requests are merged on the [next version](./5-release-process.mdx#next-version) of Docusaurus.

It is a good way to **give feedback to maintainers**, ensuring the newly implemented feature works as intended.
